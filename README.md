# ISA-QAP-InstanceGeneration

Generator code for instances in the initial instance space.

## AllRandom

Problem data produced by uniform random distribution.

## Drexx

As proposed by Z. Drezner, P. Hahn and E. Taillard in Section 2.1 of "Recent Advances for the Quadratic Assignment Problem with Special Emphasis on Instances that are Difficult for Meta-Heuristic Methods", Annals of Operations Research 139, 65–94, 2005. Our instances of this class are taken from the online library rather than using this generator, but the distance generator from this class is used by us to extend the instance space.

## Hypercube

As proposed in this work (citation to follow).

## Palubeckis

As proposed by G. Palubeckis in "Generating hard test instances with known optimal solution for the rectilinear quadratic assignment problem", Journal of Global Optimization, 1999, vol.15, n.2, 127-156. 

## StuFer

As proposed by T. Stutzle and S. Fernandes in "New benchmark instances for the QAP and the experimental analysis of algorithms", volume 3004 of "Lecture Notes in Computer Science".

## TaiBroken

An attempt to reproduce a generator for the tai-e type instances found at http://mistic.heig-vd.ch/taillard/problemes.dir/qap.dir/qap.html - our instance space does not contain any instances produced using this generator.

## TaillardB 

As proposed by E. Taillard in "Comparison of iterative searches for the quadratic assignment problem". These augment the similar instances already present in QAPLIB.

## TaiTerminal

As proposed by Z. Drezner, P. Hahn and E. Taillard in Section 2.1 of "Recent Advances for the Quadratic Assignment Problem with Special Emphasis on Instances that are Difficult for Meta-Heuristic Methods", Annals of Operations Research 139, 65–94, 2005.
